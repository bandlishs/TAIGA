It is a text based game that will automatically generate the story based on the users input and action. The only part of the
story required to initiate the game is the first few lines. The program will analyse the provided script and generate the
story. It will then wait forthe userinput as it will be used to generate the story further. This ensures that the user doesnâ€™t
have to play the same story again and can play different scenarios of the same story
